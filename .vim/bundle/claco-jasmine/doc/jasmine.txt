1. Overview~

  The jasmine plugin is meant to speed up development and testing of
JasmineBDD projects within Vim, including file type detection, snippets,
templates, red/green test running and :make compiler support.

2. File Type Detection~

  This plugin currently uses the JasmineBDD naming conventions to detect and
set buffers file type to 'jasmine.javascript'. This file type applies jasmine
specific options as well as all of the current javascript settings.

  All *Spec.js and *SpecHelper.js buffers are mapped to
the jasmine file type when they are opened, saved or created. You can map
other files patterns using 'autocmd' as necessary.

Jasmine buffers have their 'compiler' set to the jasmine compiler, which
is just 'rake'.

==============================================================================
                                                              *jasmine_syntax*
3. Syntax~

  When the jasmine file type is set, all of the jasmine and jasmine jqeury
keywords are highlighted with the *Special* code with the exception of
xit/xdescription, which are highlighted with the *Error* group.

  In addition to all of the keywords, any matcher following the .toBeSomething
pattern will also be highlighted.

                                                            *jasmine_snippets*
4. Snippets~

  If snipmate.vim is loaded, the snippets directory in this plugin will be
loaded into vim when you open your first jasmine buffer. These snoppets
include:

  desc:       description block with before..it..expect
  before:     beforeEach block
  after:      afterEach block
  it:         itâ€¦expect block
  helper:     beforeEach block and addMatcher/matcher blocks for SpecHelper.js
  matcher:    matcher block for SpecHelper.js
  expect:     expect..to line
  spy:        spyOn method

See |jasmine_settings| for specifying an alternate path for the snippets
directory.

==============================================================================
                                                           *jasmine_templates*
5. Templates~

  When opening a new buffer matching the |jasmine_filetype| pattern, a new
Spec.js or SpecHelper.js template will be inserted into the new buffer
automatically from the templates directory.

See |jasmine_settings| for specifying an alternate template path or
disabling templates completely.

==============================================================================
                                                            *jasmine_commands*
8. Commands~

  The following commands are available for jasmine buffers:

  :JasmineRedGreen

    Runs the jasmine:ci rake task for the current buffers Rakefile and
    displays the red/green test status.

  :JasmineMake

    Runs the jasmine:ci rake task using 'make', the jasmine compiler and the
    buffers Rakefile.

==============================================================================
                                                            *jasmine_redgreen*
7. Red/Green Test Running~

  When editing a jasmine buffer, you can run the test suite using <leader>m,
which simply runs the :JasmineRedGreen command.

When editing multiple jasmine buffers, maybe even in different projects,
this plugin will search parent directories for the active buffer looking for
the nearest Rakefile, then runs jasmine:ci.

If any tests fail, the status bar turns Red, and prints the passing/failing
test counts. When all tests pass, the status bar turns Green.

==============================================================================
                                                            *jasmine_settings*
8. Settings~

  g:jasmine_use_templates

    When set, new buffers are loaded with Spec/Helper templates.
    Set to ""/0 to disabled templating for jasmine buffers.

  g:jasmine_templates_directory

    When set, this is the directory templates will be loaded from.
    When unset, the templates directory relative to the plugin will be used.

  g:jasmine_snippets_directory

    When set, this is where snippets are loaded from.
    When unset, the snippets directory relative to the plugin will be used.
